# indirect_system_calls

## Overview
This repository showcases malware evasion techniques using C, focused on evading detection through indirect syscalls and encrypted payloads. The code dynamically resolves system call numbers from ntdll.dll for indirect syscall execution, enhancing its stealth against static analysis tools. It also employs AES encryption for payloads, which are decrypted at runtime to avoid signature-based detection systems. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding and researching sophisticated malware evasion strategies in a Windows environment.
